"""
Detects races that should be excluded from ELO calculations.

Two detection strategies:
1. Subset detection - races whose athletes are a subset of another same-date, same-gender race
   (e.g. U23 results extracted from Elite race, championship results within a larger cup)
2. Oversized races - >100 entries, likely combined AG + elite, needs manual review

Usage:
    python -m ptd_data.ignored
