How are the ratings calculated?

We use an extension of the ELO chess rating system that is adapted for multiple competitors and time-based endurance sports. A higher rating is better and the ratings have no minimum or maximum (ratings can be negative). Elite (including Junior and U23) athletes start with a rating of 1750 overall and for each discipline. 

Before a race, your ratings are compared to those of other athletes in the race to find a predicted outcome. A large rating difference implies a bigger predicted time difference e.g. we expect a 2500 athlete to beat a 1500 athlete by a large amount while a 2300 should only narrowly beat a 2200. After the race, we compare the predicted performance to the actual performance overall and across each discipline. If an athlete performs better than expected, they gain points; if they do worse than expected, they lose points.

Why is this better than the normal World Triathlon ranking system?
1. **Quality of field is always taken into account.** PTD ratings measure performance relative to the strength of the competition, rather than using finishing position, raw times, or fixed points tables. This provides a more accurate picture of what a strong performance looks like in any given race. As a result, racing in higher-quality fields offers greater opportunity to gain rating points. Athletes are not penalised for stepping up to harder levels of racing simply because their finishing position is lower. Instead, they are rewarded for performing better than their established level, regardless of where they place. An athlete can even finish last and still gain rating points if they exceed expectations.
2. **Easy races cannot be used to *farm* points.** WT awards the same points for all races of a given level, regardless of field strength or winning margin. This allows athletes to target weaker races to accumulate points, benefitting those who have the resources to travel to many 'easy' races. This is not possible under the PTD system. High-rated athletes competing in lower-level races must win by a significant margin to maintain their rating and narrow victories over weaker fields may even result in rating losses.
3. **Competitive racing is encouraged.** The WT ranking system offers few or no points to athletes outside the top finishing positions. In contrast, PTD ratings allow athletes at all positions to improve their rating. If an athlete has had a poor swim or bike and can no longer improve their overall placing, there is still a strong incentive to race hard. Every second gained affects will improve their overall, and their run rating particularly, in this situation. This encourages sustained competition from start to finish, rather than racing solely for position.
4. **A fairer tool for comparing athletes.** PTD ratings make it possible to compare athletes even if they have never raced each other directly. Because every performance is measured relative to the strength of the competition, all athletes are effectively ranked on the same scale. This means performances from different races, countries, and competition levels can be compared meaningfully. An athlete racing primarily in one region can be fairly assessed against another racing elsewhere, even if their race calendars never overlap. As a result, PTD ratings provide a clear and consistent way to compare athletes across the sport, rather than relying solely on head-to-head results or limited race encounters.
5. **Progress for developing athletes is easier to track.** For developing athletes, tracking improvement can be difficult under the WT system, particularly when race opportunities are limited, when results fall outside points-paying positions, or when they are transitioning between age categories. PTD ratings provide continuous feedback on performance. Athletes can see rating changes after every race, even if they do not score WT points or achieve high placings, and discipline-specific ratings give a more nuanced breakdown of their performance than a simple time or position. This allows athletes and coaches to track development over time, identify genuine performance gains, and assess readiness for higher-level competition based on objective improvement rather than occasional results.
