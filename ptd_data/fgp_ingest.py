"""
French Grand Prix ingest — pulls the FFTRI Triathlon Series (ex "Grand Prix de
Triathlon", the French D1/D2 club championship) from the ProLiveSport API that
backs triathlonseries.fr, and inserts the individual "Scratch" results into
the shared DB schema alongside WT short-course data.

Usage:
    python -m ptd_data.fgp_ingest

Runs after the WT ingest and before the PTO ingest (see scripts/build_db.sh):
FGP athletes must exist before PTO matching scans unlinked rows, and FGP
matching itself wants the freshest WT roster.

Source quirks (all verified against the API + archived live pages):
  - Discovery: POST {API}//0/X/saison/ lists every stage of every season with
    eventId + the four races (D1F/D1H/D2F/D2H). Results: GET
    {API}/{eventId}/{race}/resultIndiv/. Athlete detail (full birth date):
    GET {API}//0/{fftri_id}/athlete/" — the trailing double-quote is literally
    part of the URL the official frontend requests.
  - 2021 is skipped entirely: the API's rank/time columns for 2021 hold the
    position at T2, not the finish (checked vs contemporary Wayback snapshots
    of the live pages — the real Dunkerque winner sits at API rank 16), and
    run splits are absent, so true finish order is unrecoverable.
  - 2022-2023 store splits as swim/t1/bike in T1-T3, the cumulative time after
    the bike in T4, and t2 in T5; the run split is derived as
    total - cumulative - t2. 2024+ store the five plain segment durations.
  - Metz 2022 D1F/D1H ran as a team time-trial (rows are clubs, not athletes)
    and is skipped. Saint-Jean-de-Monts 2023 rows carry no licence/splits;
    identity is recovered by joining the startlist on bib number.
  - Event dates are not exposed by the public API. EVENT_DATES below was
    pulled once from their ERP endpoint (plus FFTRI news for the 2023 rows the
    ERP returns as null) and is maintained by hand: a stage missing from it
    fails the run loudly.

Athlete identity mirrors the PTO ingest. The FFTRI licence id is the identity
within this source: two result rows carrying different ids are two different
people, full stop, and athletes.fftri_id makes that sticky across runs. Fuzzy
matching exists only to bridge *sources* — to attach a licence to a WT or
Bundesliga row nothing has claimed yet — so it scans unlicensed athletes only,
prefiltered on nationality and gender, then year of birth (±1, from the
athlete-detail birth date) + accent-insensitive name similarity. Unmatched
athletes are minted as new rows; plausible-but-unconfirmed pairs are written
to data/fgp_merge_candidates.csv for manual review via data/athlete_merges.csv,
and pairs a human has rejected go in data/athlete_no_merge.csv.
