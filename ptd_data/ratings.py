"""
Computes ELO ratings and world/national rankings from race results in DuckDB.

Processes all races chronologically, computes pairwise log-time-ratio ELO
across 5 disciplines (overall, swim, bike, run, transition) with Glicko-style
confidence weighting, then computes world and national rankings per gender.

Confidence model:
  - Each athlete tracks a race count. Confidence = min(1, race_count / CONF_THRESHOLD).
  - Self-K multiplier: new athletes move faster (2.5× at race 0, linearly decaying to 1× over CONF_THRESHOLD races).
  - Opponent weight: pairings against established athletes count more than against newcomers.

Usage:
    python -m ptd_data.ratings
