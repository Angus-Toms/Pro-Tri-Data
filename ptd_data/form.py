"""Athlete form model: discipline-level form from split history.

Each finishing split is converted to rel = ln(split / race_median_split),
removing course length and conditions to first order. The remaining field-
strength confound is removed by alternating least squares (athlete form vs
per-race adjustment). A local-level Kalman filter tracks each athlete's form
through the adjusted observations - process variance grows with days since
their last race - and the posterior is blended with the rating-implied form
(discipline Elo mapped linearly into rel space).

Validated in analysis/{form_model,model_compare,form_only_eval}.py: on long
course the form model beats the winner-anchored prediction pipeline on both
ordering and outright times, so long-course race predictions read from here.
Short-course race predictions use the pure ELO anchor, not form; short course
only computes swim/run form here, for the athlete-page form display.

Weak, poorly-connected tiers (Development Regional Cups) get their course
constant anchored to the neutral baseline (see compute_form), since ALS can't
gauge their field strength and would otherwise leave their form inflated.

Two tables, rebuilt by compute_form() during the ratings 'models' phase:

  athlete_form         (race_id, athlete_id, discipline, form_rel, n_obs)
      blended form *after* that race. Pre-race form for race R = the latest
      row strictly before R's date (same pattern as the ratings table), so
      historical race pages stay leakage-free. Latest row = current form.
  form_race_constants  (race_id, discipline, c)
      course constant C = ln(median_split) + field adjustment. Predicted
      split = exp(form_rel + C_est), with C_est estimated from the event's
      past editions (see queries.get_form_course_constants).

Kalman/blend hyperparameters are frozen from the analysis tuning runs
(June 2026); the cheap parts (ALS, per-tier observation noise, Elo map) are
refit on every compute.
