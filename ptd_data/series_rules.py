"""Rule-based series population.

Runs as part of the ingest pipeline to auto-populate `event_series` and
`recurring_events` from the events table. Rules are matched against events;
each matching rule adds an (event, series) row. Recurring-aware rules also
group events by a normalized venue key so e.g. all "Lanzarote World Cup"
events across years share one recurring_event row.

CSV overrides (ptd_data/data/event_series.csv) run after this module.
