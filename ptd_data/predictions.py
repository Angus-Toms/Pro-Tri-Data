"""Build-time precompute of race predictions and course conditions.

Predictions are a pure function of the weekly read-only DB (pre-race ratings,
form, prediction models, start lists), so they are computed once per build and
served straight from the race_predictions / race_course_conditions tables.
The anchor/form logic here previously lived in app/routers/race_page.py and
ran on every race-page request.

Covers:
  - completed elite races (predicted results table + pos diffs on race pages)
  - upcoming races with start lists (race page, event podium, athlete page)
  - course conditions, pooled per event across its elite races

Run as the build step after ratings: python3 -m ptd_data.predictions
